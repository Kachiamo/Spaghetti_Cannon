## Background
We built a service that allows users to select trading strategies for stocks and train ML models to follow those strategies.Trading platforms can use this product as a white-lablel product to allow their platform users to purchase machine learning trading strategies. 

## Process
Data Retrieval
Data Modification
Signals Implementation
Machine Learning Models
Webapp(Django)

Analytical Approach:                       
Descriptive: Use historical SP500 Market Data to determine timeframe Diagnostic: Which trading strategy and machine learning model will be most profitable? Prescriptive: Use the trading signals to determine which model performs the best.  Cognitive: Use webapp assist trading decisions 
Machine Learning (Predictive): Use models and the trading strategies to determine which trade will be the most profitable
